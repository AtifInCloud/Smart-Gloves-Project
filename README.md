# Smart Gloves for the Hearing and Speech Impaired

This project aims to design a wearable device that translates hand gestures into speech or text, facilitating communication for deaf and mute individuals.

## Project Overview
The Smart Gloves use a combination of flex sensors, an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope, and machine learning algorithms to recognize and translate gestures.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Flex Sensors
- MPU6050 (Accelerometer and Gyroscope)
- Arduino IDE
- Python
- Random Forest Algorithm for machine learning

## Setup and Usage
### Arduino
Upload the `smart_gloves.ino` file to your Arduino Mega 2560.

### Python
Install the required Python libraries and run the `live_signal.py` and `trainingmodel.py` scripts.

## Files and Directories
- `Arduino_Code/`: Contains the Arduino source code.
- `Python_Code/`: Contains the Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- `Documentation/`: Contains project documentation and related files.
