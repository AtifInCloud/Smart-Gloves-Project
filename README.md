# Smart Gloves for the Hearing and Speech Impaired

This project aims to design a wearable device that translates hand gestures into speech or text, facilitating communication for deaf and mute individuals.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Flex Sensors
- MPU6050 (Accelerometer and Gyroscope)
- Arduino IDE
- Python
- Random Forest Algorithm for machine learning

## Setup and Usage
### Arduino
Upload the `smart_gloves.ino` file to your Arduino Mega 2560.

### Python
Install the required Python libraries and run the `smart_gloves_ml.py` script.

## Future Prospects
- Expanded vocabulary of gestures
- Advanced machine learning models
- Additional sensors for precise gesture detection
- Mobile app integration
